          <p><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies</strong></p>
          <p>- First and Third-Party Cookies</p>
          <p>A “cookie” is a small file created by a web server that can be stored on your device (if you allow) for use either during a particular browsing session (a “session” cookie) or a future browsing session (a “persistent” cookie). “Session” cookies are temporarily stored on your device and remain there until they expire at the end of your browsing session. “Persistent” cookies remain stored on your device until they expire or are deleted by you. Local shared objects (or “flash” cookies) are used to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from, and on a website. First-party cookies are set by the website you are visiting, and they can only be read by that site. Third-party cookies are set by a party other than that website.</p>
          <p>- Other Similar Technologies</p>
          <p>In addition to cookies, there are other data collection technologies, such as Internet tags, web beacons, pixels (clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs), and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, etc.) that can be used to collect data as you navigate through and interact with a website. For example, web beacons are tiny graphics with unique identifiers that are used to understand browsing activity. UTM codes are strings that can appear in a URL when you move from one web page or website to another. The string can represent information about your browsing, such as which advertisement, page, or publisher sent you to the receiving website.</p>

          <p><strong>HOW LONG DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
          <p>We retain and use your personal information for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, to comply with our business requirements and legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to protect our assets, to provide our services, and to enforce our agreements.</p>
          <p>We take reasonable steps to delete the personal information we collect when (1) we have a legal obligation to do so, (2) we no longer have a purpose for retaining the information, and (3) if you ask us to delete your information, unless we determine that doing so would violate our existing, legitimate legal, regulatory, dispute resolution, contractual, or similar obligations. We may also decide to delete your personal information if we believe it is incomplete, inaccurate, or that our continued storage of your personal information is contrary to our legal obligations or business objectives.</p>
          <p>To the extent permitted by law, we may retain and use anonymous, de-identified, and aggregated information for performance reporting, benchmarking, and analytic purposes and for product and service improvement. When we delete data, it will be removed from our active servers and databases; but, it may remain in our archives when it is not practical or possible to delete it.</p>
          <p><strong>HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></p>
          <p>We have put security measures in place to protect personal information from being accidentally lost, used, altered, or disclosed or accessed in an unauthorized manner and to detect fraudulent identify-verification activity, including when transmitting personal information in response to data subject requests. From time to time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technologies and methods.</p>
          <p>We use SSL technology to encrypt data in transit, and we also encrypt data at rest on our systems.  We do not store or save your financial information.  While our security measures seek to protect your personal information in our possession, no security system is perfect, and no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our Site, and you do so at your own risk.  We cannot promise that your personal information will remain absolutely secure in all circumstances.</p>
          <p>The safety and security of your personal information also depends on you. Where you use a password for access to restricted parts of the Site, you are responsible for keeping the password confidential.  Do not share your password with anyone.</p>
          <p>If a security breach compromises your personal information, we will notify you and any applicable regulator when we are required to do so by applicable law.</p>

          <p><strong>Right of Access</strong>. To the extent required by law, you have the right to receive confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning you are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and the following information: the purposes of the processing; the categories of personal data concerned; and the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed. We will provide a copy of your personal information in compliance with applicable law.</p>

In some cases, you have a legal right to request that we delete your personal information when (1) it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, (2) consent has been withdrawn in certain instances, (3) you have objected to the processing in certain instances, (4) the personal information has been unlawfully processed, (5) the personal data have to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation; and (6) the personal data were collected in relation to the offer of information society services.

          <p><strong>Right to Object</strong>.

Once we have received notice that you have withdrawn your consent, in whole or in part, we will no longer process your information for the purpose(s) to which you originally consented and have since withdrawn unless there are compelling legitimate grounds for further processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. Withdrawal of consent to receive marketing communications will not affect the processing of personal information for the provision of our services.</p>
